Analysis procedure for f3 tests

Individuals of Yoruba populations from the one-thousand-genomes
project were merged with original dataset using mergeit.

F3 tests were run in the R interface of ADMIXTOOLS 2.
It uses a block-jacknife resampling method to compute standard errors.
SNP block size was 50cM.
adjust_pseudohaploid was set to TRUE, as the data were not diploid.

Statistics were generated by calculating f2 blocks seperately per
combination of populations. By calculating f2 blocks seperately
for each combination of populations, SNPs that may be missing
in other populations but are present in populations in question
are included in the f3 calculation (whereas they would have been
discarded).

F3 were calculated as follows: (YRI, TARGET) * (YRI, SOURCE)
where TARGET is one of the apoikia sequenced populations and
SOURCE is a populations as described in "Labels_for_f3.tsv".
YRI were individuals from Yoruba population of the
one-thousand-genomes project.
Results were saved in "f3_TARGET.tsv" and plots were saved  
in f3_TARGET.png

"Labels_for_f3.tsv" demonstratess the individuals that were included
in the analysis, and the populations that they were grouped in.

Additional F3 results were calculated seperately for each individual
in the TARGET populations, except for populations "Tenea Archaic"
and "Tenea Early Roman" that only had one individual anyway.
Results were saved in ind_f3_TARGET.tsv and plots were saved
in f3_TARGET_with_individuals.png
